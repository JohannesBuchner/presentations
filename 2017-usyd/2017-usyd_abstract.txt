Virtually all X-rays observed in deep fields originate close to
growing supermassive black holes. X-rays indeed provide a clean and
efficient selection of both unobscured and obscured AGN (active galactic
nuclei).
Recent work with deeper observations and improved analysis methodology
allowed us to extend constraints on highly obscured, Compton-thick
growth, thought to occur e.g. as a phase in mergers.
We put constraints on the mass locked into black holes over cosmic time,
an important constraint for cosmological simulations and our
understanding of the co-evolution with galaxies.
Further study of the obscurer of AGN reveals a complex behaviour with
luminosity and redshift, which rules out entire sets of obscurer models.
A new paradigm is proposed, the radiation-lifted torus model,
in which the obscurer is Eddington-rate dependent and radiation pressure
from the accretion process creates and displaces torus clouds. We place
observational limits on the behaviour of this mechanism.
