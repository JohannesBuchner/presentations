How the first super-massive black holes (SMBHs) are formed is a highly
debated research topic, as are their accretion limits, growth and
co-evolution with galaxies. I will present how independent of these
questions, we can investigate the occurance of SMBH seeds with a simple
generic framework from modern cosmological dark matter N-body
simulations. This exposes the link of the local occupation fraction
observations and z=6 quasar space densities, and demonstrates that there
should be a large, quiet population of SMBHs. Major progress will be
made with future space-based gravitational wave detections, as the
frequency and redshift distribution of events pin-point the creation and
merging efficiency.
