A robust determination of fraction of obscured and Compton-thick AGN
is a long-standing issue in AGN research. We address this problem using
a multi-tiered survey of 2000 X-ray hard-band detected AGN with
redshifts in the range z=0.5-4. The X-ray spectrum of each source is
analysed using a Bayesian fitting technique capable of handling the low
X-ray counts, errors in the optical counterpart identification of
X-ray sources and uncertainties in photometric redshift determination.
This yields luminosities in the interval L=10^42-46 erg/s and column
densities extending into the Compton thick regime, N_H=1e20-1e26 cm^-2.
For determining the column density distribution and luminosity
function, I will present a new Bayesian non-parametric method which
propagates all uncertainties. The fraction of Compton-thick AGN is
constrained to 38(+-8)% averaged over cosmic time, while obscured
(NH>1e22) AGN represent 78%(+-5) of the population. These fractions
evolve with cosmic time, as AGN of different obscurations show
distinct evolutionary patterns, with AGN around NH~1e23 cm^-2 evolving
the fastest. We study the luminosity dependence of the fraction of
obscured AGN in detail, and find that this relationship too evolves
over cosmic time. Physically motivated models that can explain the
observed trends will be discussed.
