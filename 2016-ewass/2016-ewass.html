<h1>Separating the nuclear and galaxy-scale obscuration in AGN</h1><p><b>Abstract</b>: Gas has a dual role in the Universe: it creates light e.g. by fusion in stars and
accretion onto compact objects, but it also absorbs and extincts light. The most
dense gas in the universe is probed by bright X-ray point sources, which includes
exploding stars in the form of Gamma Ray Bursts and accreting black holes (AGN).
Both frequently show extreme levels of gas column densities of ~10 22 /cm2 (GRB)
and 10 24 /cm2 (AGN). An open research question is how such thick obscurers with
large covering fractions are created and maintained. On the way to answering this
question, my research clarifies the role of galaxy-scale obscuration, through (1) X-
ray tomography reconstruction of host galaxy gas using GRB line-of-sight column
densities and (2) by analysing modern hydrodynamic cosmological simulations which
give well-constrained predictions for the gas content of galaxies. With the host
galaxy obscuration understood, observations provide useful constraints for models of
AGN and GRB obscurers on the covering fraction at various levels of absorption.
