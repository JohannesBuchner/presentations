<p>Ongoing research deals with the problem that the reflection hump and Fe-line is pronounced to various degrees. Introducing additional reflection (see Figure 1, right column) is very strongly preferred by model selection, however there are sources which show a weaker Fe-line than the torus model predicts, potentially indicative of a different geometry, ionization state or metallicity.</p>

<p><b>Figure 2.</b> Most observed spectra, like the strongly obscured one shown here, can be described by a powerlaw source embedded in a torus of constant density (“torus”, green area) and a “scattering” powerlaw (red area). The  model with background (blue) is in agreement with the observed counts (green points).</p>
<p><b>Figure 1.</b> Various geometries considered. The left first four cases represent zero, small, medium and large covering fractions respectively. Additional components, such as Thomson-scattering off ionized clouds (soft scattering) and reflection are considered (see text).</p>
<p>(1) extract the most information from typically low signal-to-noise spectra of z~1 AGN, which represent the  majority of black hole growth in the Universe.</p>
<p>(2) compare various non-nested models  using Bayesian model selection (see Figure 1, left column) corresponding to different geometries.</p>
<p>Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) show obscuration due to cold, neutral material in the line of sight. With a Bayesian analysis  method, X-ray selected AGN in the Chandra Deep Field South (CDF-S) were analysed using a range of X-ray models. Using Bayesian model selection, we find that the obscurer has to have a large covering geometry with strong Compton reflection.</p>
<p>The sphere or torus geometry
with a scattering component (see Figure 2) rule out all
other geometries with very strong evidence (Bayes factor &gt; 30). We find:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Obscured AGN require a model based on multiple photon interactions.</i></li>
<li><i>The obscurer extends outside the line of sight with a large covering fraction.</i></li>
<li><i>Thomson scattering is important in ~10% of sources, making an unobscured opening physically necessary</i></li>
<p><i></i></p>
</ul>
<p>AGN are thought to intrinsically emit a Comptonized spectrum in X-rays which can be approximated by a powerlaw. The variety of observed spectra is attributed largely to viewing angles (unification scheme). Interaction processes such as photoelectric absorption, Fe fluorescence and Compton-scattering determine the spectral shape in dependence of the obscurer geometry and density.</p>
<p>Using a Bayesian approach, we analyse X-ray spectra of 413 X-ray detected AGN in the CDF-S. This method allows us to </p>
