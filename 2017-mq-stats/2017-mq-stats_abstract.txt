I will cover some methods for tasks astronomers face daily:
(1) measuring a quantity of an astrophysical object (e.g. luminosity)
under uncertainty (2) Combining multiple such uncertain objects
 for understanding the distribution of the population, sometimes under
 censorship. (3) comparing complex models of physical effects.
New algorithms and easy-to-use implementations, including (Py)MultiNest
and Stan, today make powerful tools available for analysing real
problems with sufficient complexity.
Briefly, I will also give an overview of my X-ray astronomy research,
which includes AGN obscuration, SMBH growth over cosmic time, GRBs and
the analysis of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations.
