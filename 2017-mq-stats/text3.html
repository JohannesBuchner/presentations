<h1><b>Intro: p-values</b></h1>
<ul>
<li>p&lt;0.001 – from Pearson correlation, KS test, etc.
what can you infer:</li>
<ul>
<li>You have absolutely disproved the null hypothesis (e.g. &quot;no correlation&quot; is ruled out, the data are not sampled from this model, there is no difference between the samples).</li>
<li>You have found the probability of the null hypothesis being true.</li>
<li>You have absolutely proved your experimental hypothesis (e.g. that there is a correlation, there is a difference between two samples, the data are sampled from this model).</li>
<li>You can deduce the probability of the experimental hypothesis being true.</li>
<li>You know, if you decide to reject the null hypothesis, the probability that you are making the wrong decision.</li>
<li>You have a reliable experimental finding in the sense that if, hypothetically, the experiment were repeated a great number of times, you would obtain a significant result on 99.9% of occasions.</li>
</ul>
<li>Choose the right answer A - F</li>
</ul>
