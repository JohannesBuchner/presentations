AGN surveys in the X-ray regime have revealed that the majority of AGN
(3/4) are obscured, with 1/3 showing Compton-thick column densities.
This indicates that hidden accretion is an important phase in the growth
of super-massive black holes. However, it remains unclear how much of
this obscuration is already provided by the host galaxy itself; a
question which cannot be answered using a central point source alone.
Our novel approach employs 600 long gamma-ray bursts to “x-ray” the
metal gas in galaxies at. This requires a good understanding of the
obscurer and biases introduced. The highly complete SHOALS survey
allowed us to discover a relation between stellar masses and X-ray
derived column densities NH, pointing to the host galaxy as the dominant
obscurer of LGRBs. This obscuration is expected according to local
galaxy analogues and current hydrodynamic cosmological simulations.
We could then constrain the typical covering factor of the nuclear AGN
obscurer (torus) alone by subtracting away the host galaxy contribution,
under some caveats related to star-formation rate of AGN hosts. Our
findings recast the discussion of the evolution and
luminosity-dependence of the AGN obscured fraction.
