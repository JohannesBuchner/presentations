Within the framework of torus geometries, the covering fractions of
material of various densities corresponds to the fraction of
Compton-thin and Compton-Thick (CT) obscured AGN in the population.
One way to constrain the obscurer geometry is thus to study the joint
luminosity function and column density distribution of the AGN populatio
n.
I have recently provided a robust and non-parametric estimate of the
distribution of X-ray selected AGN in obscuration as a function of
redshift (Buchner et al. 2015). I will present the comparison of these
results to recent hydrodynamical simulations and discuss the
implications on the torus structure.
I will briefly review the luminosity-dependence of the obscurer as
observed in surveys. Newest results indicate a redshift evolution and
a potential dependence on Eddington ratio and black hole mass. This
puts constraints on the origin and scale of the obscuring material,
including contribution from gas and dust clouds on kpc-scales
associated with the host galaxy. It also constrains proposed
mechanisms for creation and maintenance of the torus.
