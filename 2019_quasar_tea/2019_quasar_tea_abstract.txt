The growth of Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) lights up galaxies
spectacularly and likely shapes them. I will discuss my observational
and theoretical research constraining the underlying SMBH population
from their seeding down to the giants we see in the local Universe.
Obscuration and low levels of activity make detecting SMBH challenging
and require advanced techniques. We can shed light on the surroundings
of growing SMBHs on various scales through measurements of the accretion
history up to the highest levels of obscurations and with independent
measurements on the effects of galaxy-scale gas. I will conclude with my
current work on improving models and observations of clumpy sub-parsec
obscuration with eROSITA.
