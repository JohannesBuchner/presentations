<h1>Robust and complete Demographics of Active Galactic Nuclei</h1><p><b>Abstract</b>: A robust determination of fraction of obscured and Compton-thick AGN
is a long-standing issue in AGN research. We address this question using a
multi-tiered survey of 2000 X-ray hard-band detected AGN covering well
the redshift range of z=0.5-4, luminosities of L=10^42-46 erg/s and
column densities of NH=10^20-26 cm^-2. We analyse the spectrum of each
source in detail with a Bayesian fitting technique capable of
handling also the low counts, and propagate errors in association and
photometric redshift. We developed a new non-parametric method that
reveals the distribution of the AGN population in luminosity,
obscuration and redshift.
We find the fraction of Compton-thick AGN to be 36%(+-8) averaged over
cosmic time, while 75%(+-4) AGN are obscured. These fractions evolve
with cosmic time, as AGN of different obscuration show distinct
evolutionary patterns, with AGN around NH~10^23 cm^-2 evolving
fastest. We study the luminosity dependence of the fraction of
obscured and Compton-thick AGN in detail, and find that this
relationship evolves over cosmic time.
In my talk I will discuss models that can explain the large fraction
of Compton-thick AGN as well as the luminosity-obscuration relationship.
