Thick gas and dust obscures most active galactic nuclei. However, little
is currently known about its geometry, origin and why the covering
factors are so high. With NuSTAR spectroscopy, we can now probe the
geometry of the obscurer through its X-ray reprocessing effects at
8-40keV. We quickly learn that current models have severe difficulties,
and do not produce the observed spectral shapes. To highlight this, I
present a new hard X-ray color-color diagram, contrasting Compton-humps
of observations and existing models. We also illuminate new
physically-motivated AGN obscurer geometries. The observed colors that
are difficult to reach by models allow general conclusions about the
arrangement of gas and dust around AGN, and directions for future models.
