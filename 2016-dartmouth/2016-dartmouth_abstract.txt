AGN surveys in the X-ray regime have revealed that the majority of AGN
(3/4) are obscured, with 1/3 showing Compton-thick columns. This
indicates that hidden accretion is an important phase in the growth of
super-massive black holes. However, it remains unclear how much of this
obscuration is provided by the host galaxy; a question which can not be
answered using a central point source.
Our novel approach employs 600 long gamma-ray bursts to x-ray galaxies.
From the column densities we reconstruct the gas distribution of a
statistically average galaxy at z=0.5-3. We find a host stellar-mass
dependence but little redshift evolution. Our result can be applied to
the AGN population, under some caveats (star-formation rate,
metallicity). Under the AGN stellar-mass distribution, we find that host
galaxy gas does not provide Compton-thick column densities, but is an
important, luminosity-independent obscurers at N_H~1e22/cmÂ².
Our approach allows us to separate the galaxy-scale gas and nuclear
("torus") obscurer, and sheds light on the luminosity-dependence of the
torus as well as its covering factors. We corroborate our findings by
ray-tracing hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies, and analytic limits
valid also to mergers.
