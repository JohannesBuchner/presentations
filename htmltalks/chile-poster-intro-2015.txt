 For your convenience I put what the fraction of Compton-thick AGN in the Universe is
 
 right there, it is 38%+-8%.
 
 And this is the fraction of obscured AGN, also averaged over cosmic time.
 These numbers should be quite robust, because all selection biases and uncertainties are incorporated, and no empirical models are assumed.
 
 My name is Johannes Buchner. Today I am presenting a paper just accepted to ApJ
 which you can find here. My collaborators are listed in the top right.
 
 Let me explain the measurement. We used hard X-ray detected 2000 AGN, for which we analysed the 
 spectra in detail with realistic, physically motivated models, incorporating redshift uncertainties.
 In 2014, I published a Bayesian method for X-ray spectral analysis, which gives for each object probability distributions in 
 intrinsic X-ray luminosity, redshift and obscuring column density.
 This is then propagated into a luminosity function approach, incorporating the selection bias.
 And here I am simultaneously constraining the NH distribution and the luminosity function as well as their evolution,
 and this is done in a non-parametric way.
 
 Now that I have the AGN demographics I can devide the population by obscuration.
 For the Compton-thick fraction, I do not find any luminosity dependence at any redshift intervals, and averaged over
 cosmic time it is 38%.
 For the remainder of the population, I find the well-known luminosity dependence of the obscured fraction.
 Comparing across redshift panels -- the red star is always at the same point -- the luminosity dependence appears to set on at higher and higher luminosities. The whole shape appears to move to the right, also connecting to local observations.
  And in the paper I speculate on why such a evolution would appear. Essentially, this is possible if there is mass downsizing, as mentioned by Andreas Schulze, as the destruction of obscuration depends on black hole mass in some models.
