Most Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are obscured by thick layers of gas
and dust. Diverse theoretical models and suggested geometries have been
proposed, the oldest of which is a torus. In this talk I review what has
been learned recently about the importance of the galaxy-scale
obscuration, the behaviour of the nuclear obscurer and first attempts at
imaging the parsec-size structure. Finally, I present a new approach to
"image" the torus substructure using eclipse events in X-rays.
